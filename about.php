		<p class="about">HP is the man behind the success. He started his career as an apprentice for Micheal Guldman, and has since then had his own shops in both Kolding and Odense.
HP has tattooed for about 20 years, and has taught up several talented artists during this time. He has taught up both Jonas and Simon who are now co-owners of the shop in Aarhus. 
HP is skillful in all styles, but has always had a certain eye for oriental. He loves freehand work, and will gladly create big japanese pieces this way. 
HP is the sole owner of the shop in Odense and co-owner of the Aarhus shop.</p>
