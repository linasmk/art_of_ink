			<h2>Jonas Willy Brund-Andersen</a></h2>
			<div class="responsive-circle1 bgimg1"></div>
			<p class="red">Jonas started his career back in 2009 when HP took him in as an apprentice in his studio in Odense.</p>
			<p>It didn’t take long before it was decided that another shop would open in Aarhus, and Jonas moved from Odense to take care of the new shop.</p>
			<p>Today he is the co-owner of the Aarhus shop and has tattooed for almost 10 years. He tattoos in all styles and loves a good challenge – big or small, though he has always had a soft spot for traditional.</p>
