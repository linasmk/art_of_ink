					<div class="list-wrapper">
					<p>Jonas started his career back in 2009 when HP took him in as an apprentice in his studio in Odense. 
It didn’t take long before it was decided that another shop would open in Aarhus, and Jonas moved from Odense to take care of the new shop.
Today he is the co-owner of the Aarhus shop and has tattooed for almost 10 years. He tattoos in all styles and loves a good challenge – big or small, though he has always had a soft spot for traditional.

					<p>Simon started his career in Aarhus, shortly after the new shop opened in the city. 
He was taught up by HP, but spent a lot of his day to day life in company with Jonas, while also being a part of the graffiti environment, which can be seen in a lot of his earlier work. He has since then gravitated mainly towards black and grey with fine lines, dotwork, and a sense of the small details.

					<p>Kamilla is the youngest member of the group and is currently the only woman in the shop. 
She came in as an apprentice in the Aarhus shop, and can be found there daily. 
Kamilla has a fine line and does well with smaller tattoos, but enjoys doing a bit of everything. When drawing she leans towards a darker style, and is always ready to do pieces that ventures into the dark art style.
